# Pima-Indians-Diabetes-database

This dataset is originally from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. The objective of the dataset is to diagnostically predict whether or not a patient has diabetes, based on certain diagnostic measurements included in the dataset. Several constraints were placed on the selection of these instances from a larger database. In particular, all patients here are females at least 21 years old of Pima Indian heritage.
The datasets consists of several medical predictor variables and one target variable, Outcome. Predictor variables includes the number of pregnancies the patient has had, their BMI, insulin level, age, and so on.


Objecttive of this code is to text out various classification techniques - kNN, Random Forest & ANN using Pytorch

kNN - The k-nearest neighbors algorithm is a supervised machine learning algorithm that can be used to solve both classification and regression problems. It classifies the test data points based on the majority class of nearest neighors.

Random Forest - It is an ensemble learning method for classification, regression and other tasks that operate by constructing a ultitude of decision trees at training time and outputting the class that is the mode of the classes or mean/average prediction of the individual trees.
